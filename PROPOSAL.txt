Challege
- This dataset has unbalanced classes and it would be insteresting see how different optimizers and different model architecture reacts to it.

Training
- We will use different optimizers like Adam, SGD etc.with the combinations of different model architecture and if we can find it, implementation of transfer learning as well.

Evaluation
- Since dataset is imbalanced, we would be using F1-score and Average AUC to get correct evaluation of models.
